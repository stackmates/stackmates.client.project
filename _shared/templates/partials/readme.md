It should be possible to create some generic patterns such as pattern lab
that can be used to build any system.

And where deviation is needed can use the BEM / Suit convention to apply naming of file

For purposes of building with metalsmith all templates are on one file.

This whole template thing needs a think.. also need to check how a proposed system might be migrated into ember or meteor should the need arise.
