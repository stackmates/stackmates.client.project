 *
 * This goal is to make patterns that can be set by variables in the local
 * structure and connection files where sensible.
 * But wherever you want more control just copy the file locally and
 * use from there.
 *
 * There are editorial issues to address, it would be nice to be able to have
 * A project 'working set' of files that are being used.
 *
 * For purposes of navigation it could be an idea to prefix app / site specific
 * in your patterns in css names eg drmgComponent
