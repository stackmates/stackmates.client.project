The nice thing about this system is that all project can share common assets and if you want to create new landing page or a learning site, you can copy a file directory and leverage the same base assets to finish the job much quicker.

### Intent

Projects is split into two categories by [job to be done](http://jobstobedone.org/) where the following aphorism is intended to help create a strong conceptual dividing line of what website is versus an app.


<blockquote class='t-important u-textCenter'>Websites for words<br>Apps for action</blockquote>

#### Websites

Metalsmith builds the traditional static website intended for marketing information. But Metalsmith also provides opportunities for creating additional marketing materials such as pdf brochures etc.

#### Apps


For the future the biggest interest is what will have the best [famo.us](http://famo.us) integration story


### Structure

#### Websites

Templates live locally and partials can be common or local and can be used with Hapi.js so can import json from markdown file into a database json reuse the templates to serve pages from the server.

#### Apps

Angular and Ionic framework are a good combination for the opportunities to get code leverage code re-use out of desktop (Line of Business) app and mobile. Choosing angular for [it-starts-upfront](http://github.com/stackmates/it-starts-upfront) had more to do with the decision to use [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework) and the efficiency gains for developing in mobile apps.

But Angular has become the modern jQuery with so many examples that can pretty browserified pretty quickly.

The structure of angular code is a mix of [John Papa's](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide) and [Todd Motto's](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide) with the browserify twist. With the ambition to develop a full suite of [style guide examples with tests](https://github.com/stackmates/stackmates/tree/master/client/src/common/ux_patterns/angular/__style_guide)
