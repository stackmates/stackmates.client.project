This [google drive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/#folders/0B_isMPC-_gvmTXhkbDRpZWhmd0E/0B_isMPC-_gvmdlJiMTUwNE8tLVE) can be used to communicate knowledge and track important information.

### Intent

Part of the **StackMates** philosophy is delay choosing software solutions until you really know your use case. So this [project starter directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/?rfd=1#folders/0B_isMPC-_gvmdXU0YWd0UmdSLTQ/0B_isMPC-_gvmbkZhcWdaR2trVms/0B_isMPC-_gvmUXJoX0toXzdpRmc) can be used communicate for your projects. See [dreamineering](http://dreamineering.com) for a guide to the structure of this directory.

The benefit is that no-one needs to learn a new tool to understand how the project is evolving and using the external folder it is possible to use the drive as a simple CMS solution where [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io) which integrates with [google+](https://plus.google.com/) can be used streamline your workflow and take care of loading images. Unfortunately stackedit.io is a bit slow.

#### Startups

If you have a startup idea check out [Google Launch](https://developers.google.com/startups/) you will find some useful resources and receive credit on google's compute engine if your idea gets through.

### Structure

The folder structure replicates our personal thoughts, there are those that are meant for the outside world **external** and those we would rather keep to a select few **internal** 

### Learn

I've attempted to collect good ideas from around the web [here]([project  starter directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/?rfd=1#folders/0B_isMPC-_gvmdXU0YWd0UmdSLTQ/0B_isMPC-_gvmbkZhcWdaR2trVms/0B_isMPC-_gvmUXJoX0toXzdpRmc) to go with [this process](http://dreamineering.com/cards/build-a-legacy/)
