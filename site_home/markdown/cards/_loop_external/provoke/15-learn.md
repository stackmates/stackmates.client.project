**The number one ambition of StackMates is to maximise productivity**. Because learning is such an important aspect to achieving that goal, the intent is that each major concpet of the design will have [mind maps](https://www.mindmup.com/#m:g10B_isMPC-_gvmM3JSY2c1ZWFjZm8) and [ANKI flash cards](http://ankisrs.net/) to reinforce concepts.


Use this [ANKI Deck](https://github.com/stackmates/stackmates/blob/master/docs/ankis/life--learning.apkg) which teaches you the rules of memorizing content with ANKI. Then explore the [ANKI Directory](https://github.com/stackmates/stackmates/tree/master/docs/ankis) to learn more on a particular aspect of this project.

## Remember

* Be interested
* The brain love consistency
* You're only as young as the new things you do.

## Use Spaced Repitition

* [Effective learning](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm)
* [The Janki Method](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html)
* [Memorizing a programming language using spaced repetition software](http://sivers.org/srs)


Your ANKI cards should in a contant flux of adding, editing and deleting to make sure the content is relevent.
