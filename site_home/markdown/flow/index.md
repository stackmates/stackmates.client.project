As an ecosystem the idea is to expand then contract, that is grow the code in the project then slowly contract down to modules that are free to join other systems. As central principle is to mirror how life system operate where nothing is permanent.

Will need clear communication of intent by connecting why with how.


## Principles

* Expand then contract, make it work, then make it better
* We are divided by common language, but **the sequence of questions we ask ourselves provide an anchor** is what really helps understand each others ideas.
* Be opinionated enough to provide clear direction but flexible enough to change course without hangups
* Philsophers ask questions, dreamers wonder why, realists ask what, engineers explain how, be all of these.
* Go with the chaos, then find the pattern
* Consistency of style is important, 
* Communication is more important than being clever
* Don't want it, don't require it. Don't want to see it, hide it
* Work together as a spotter network
* Good design is easy to understand
