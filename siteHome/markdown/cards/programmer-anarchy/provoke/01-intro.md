Microservice architecture is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services with each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms refered to as transports, often a HTTP resource API.

These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery where there is a bare mininum of centralized management of these services and these services may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies
