**MOVING FORWARD** The best way to create software solutions is about using 1000s of tiny modules as kind of lego blocks to make big solutions.

Why not think of your tech stack like a portfolio stocks where developers and companies share the StackMates they use to build a global index that provides insights into trends for what concepts are gaining momentum for the purposes of driving education and recruitment and staying on top on innovation?

### Digital footprint

Now consider for a moment [The Operating Model That Is Eating The World](https://medium.com/@aarondignan/the-operating-model-that-is-eating-the-world-d9a3b82a5885) then ask yourself...

What is the typical digital footprint for a business that desires to evolve at the speed of the web? 

See this [mind map](https://www.mindmup.com/#m:g10B_isMPC-_gvmTU5JN0c1QjNGbjg) for more analysis, but for the purposes of evaluating a concrete example of an aspiring startup the following is a breakdown of the [Ionicframework](http://ionicframework.com/) project that is publicly available.

#### Marketing

* [home](http://ionicframework.com/)
* [learn](http://learn.ionicframework.com/)
* [blog](http://ionicframework.com/blog/)
* [presentation](http://present.ionicframework.com/)

#### Apps

##### Mobile
* Android
* IOS
* Other

##### Tablet
* Web
* Native

##### Desktop 
* Consumer facing
* Internal line of business

#### Other Solutions

* [Forum](http://forum.ionicframework.com/)
* Ecommerce

### Observations

A conservative count of github projects shows **7 build, CSS and JS configs to maintains**. If you factor in the need for specific marketing campaign pages or facebook pages this number could easily grow. 


* The blog is not a subdomain but this would be typical
* The Ionic brand is consistent in all they communicate
* Multiple build systems and CSS theme configurations
* Heavy javascript and Node bias but also use Ruby and Rails for their soluton stack
* There is no ionicframework mobile app but this would be a typical requirement
* It is unclear whether a desktop solution exists to help run their business


## Pain points 

* How much of this code is common but is copied?
* How much effort goes into updating build systems for each project?
* How much effort to align consistent branding?
* How are best UX Patterns maintained across all properties?
* Why not use JS solutions for [forum](https://nodebb.org/) or [ecommerce](https://reactioncommerce.com/)?
