communicationJob: Javascript glues the web together and <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org/industry/">node is here to stay</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/joemccann/the-business-case-for-node">business case</a> contnues to grow for node.js as it fast becomes a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/node-js-becoming-go-technology-enterprise#.U_3j0u6Swpw">core requirement</a> of the web development process.

communicationTeaching: With regards to nodejs the education market is not as comprehensive as rails by comparison, this might be due to relative age and fragmentation of solutions. It would be nice to see a leader such as <a href="http://nodesource.com">nodesource</a> follow <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot's</a> lead with rails. That said <a target="_blank" href="http://nodeschool.io/">nodeschool</a> is very good.

leadership: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.joyent.com/">Joyant:</a> Probably could be improved but have <a href="http://hueniverse.com/">Walmart</a> snapping at their heels to keep them honest

innovation: At the forefront of web innovation with a rich and rapidly evolving ecosystem with projects such as <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/winjs-3-0-shows-industry-shift-towards-javascript/">Microsoft's winjs</a>

developmentProductivity: JavaScript is the ultimate <a href="http://wildermuth.com/2014/6/22/It_Is_Time_to_Learn_JavaScript">utility language</a> and often node has been adopted by leading companies when experiments proved so productive the decision was made to go all in.

developmentPerformance: Delivers responsive (realtime) user experience while in terms of infrastructure costs Node will save you money. Node.js owes much of it's speed to google's ch

developmentFlexibility: This might be why developers have embraced node.js in the first place. While javascript is undergoing constant evolution as the language that glues the web together.


ecosystemDevelopers: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js">Attacts top talent</a> and top talent is the key to growth the beautiful thing is that it is all javascript which enables a single developer to be more productive.

ecosystemProof: <a target="_blank" href="http://strongloop.com/node-js/infographic/">Big brands</a> have already realised they can use node to grow their profits

ecosystemModules: Huge amount of open-source ecosystems with over 90,000 packages on <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM</a>
