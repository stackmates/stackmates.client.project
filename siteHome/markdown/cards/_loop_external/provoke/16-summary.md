The structure can be improved and this won't a solution for everyone. 

But there is [value in complexity](https://vimeo.com/43690647) and it seems very likely [micro-service architecture](https://vimeo.com/user22258446/review/79288222/cbb24b224c) has a strong future so hopefully this can become a useful resource for learning.

## Progress

The solution is still very early in development but it already scratches a few itches and will only get better as more ideas get added and other become cleaner with better documentation. The apps are still largely ignored but given increasingly ubiquitous coverage of angular on [dailyjs](http://dailyjs.com/) a complex solution would be easy to build up.

## Future

Analysis of StackMates would make it easier to indentify what trends were developing for the purposes of deciding how to invest efforts in education. 

To do this the next goal is allow developer to agree criteria and then give their evaluation rating of the major building blocks

### Alternatives

It would be cool to see a completely different **build engine and strategy** using something like [duo](https://github.com/duojs/duo) and [graftjs](https://github.com/GraftJS/graft) for example.

### Issues to tackle

* Figure out the what?, when?, why? and how? of the *realtime* story
* Enable a more productive action than *staring* interesting projects
* Create flash cards of main concepts with links to code for learning with context
* Develop non trivial micro-service architectured solutions with examples of the [contrasting approaches in action](http://dejanglozic.com/2014/09/16/nodeconf-eu-2014-trip-report-part-1/)
* Identify best development to production workflow with MSA and docker
