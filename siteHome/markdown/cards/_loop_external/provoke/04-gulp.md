communicationJob: Gulp runs tasks to run development environment with live browser reloading and creating production builds with performance optimisaton for your sites by minify concatenating and minifying JavaScript, CSS, HTML and images.

leadership: <a href="http://wearefractal.com">Fractal:</a> Do a good job setting gulp's strict plugin guidelines to assure plugins stay simple and work the way you expect. Work to prevent ecosystem is not populuted with pointless plugins.


communicationTeaching: Has good base of <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/README.md">resources</a>

innovation: Build processes are continually improving to automate tasks that speed the web development workflow


developmentProductivity: With a minimal API surface you can pick up gulp in no time. Your build works just like you envision it

developmentPerformance: By harnessing the power of node's streams you get fast builds that don't write intermediary files to disk.


developmentFlexibility: By preferring code over configuration, gulp keeps simple things simple and makes complex tasks manageable.


ecosystemDevelopers: Strong and growing converts from Grunt.

ecosystemProof: See <a href="https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit">Google's web starter kit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wearefractal/product-boilerplate">Fractal's own hackathon starter</a>

ecosystemModules: Over 750 curated <a href="http://gulpjs.com/plugins/">plugins</a> that carefully scrutinised to be of proven value and following good principles.

stackmatesHistory: Maintaining the build system across multiple projects I was spending more time maintaining each build system than doing the work intended.


stackmatesIntent: Cherry pick the best ideas from projects like the <a href="https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit">web starter kit</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter">gulp starter</a>. Need to sort image processing solution for RWD process.

**Features:** The major difference is that a master build system is shared by many projects so you only have to think about keeping one build system up to date.

* Clean build directories
* Fetch and compress assets such as icons, fonts, json data
* Concate and compress javascript with browserify
* Browsersync or live-reload
* Fetch cordova assets
* Images compression
* JSHint
* Run testing with karma
* Build static sites with metalsmith
* Fetch data from google spreadsheets
* Run styles through Rework or SASS
