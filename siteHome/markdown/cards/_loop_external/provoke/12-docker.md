Docker is taking over the world, everyone knows that.


### StackMates Manifest 

To be established... who is going to provide the killer tool for ease of development to production with docker and micro-services for simpletons like me? 

### Intent

Establish the best workflow from development to production with MSA by dockerizing client apps or backend services into containers that talk to each other.

Put client websites and app into containers 

Hapi - server app

#### Structure 

One service to one container

#### Substance

One container for ent service
One for database? This would allow for creating a new ent service without thinking about data migration. How else could you ensure a common data store?
